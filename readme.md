## How to add support for another language?
If you want to customize it to have more languages, you can do so by simply adding
a new JS file that will be triggered when the pattern matches the specification in `manifest.json`
Then in that script you have to get the word is being searched in the query params and create a 
new instance with the name of the language.
```javascript
let url = new URL(location.href)
let wordTranslated = url.searchParams.get("tranword")
let word = new Word(wordTranslated, "your new language")
word.updateCount()
```
